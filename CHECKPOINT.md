# v3.0-experimental checkpoint

Status: active implementation; not a complete Go replacement.
Baseline: a53b25579ab87cc98f85323b4743deb0d4da907b (codex/v2.1-b1-base / PR #45).
Branch/worktree: v3.0-experimental, /home/dgrace/nanokvm-astra/v3.0-experimental.

## Constraints
- Keep UI/API/settings/credentials/APK/OpenRC compatibility and every existing feature.
- Final replacement runtime may not run the Go server or a Go transport bridge.
- Preserve native C/C++ capture. H.265 WebRTC must always return h265-webrtc-disabled, including software crypto; direct H.265 remains in scope.
- Shared device 192.168.4.128: read-only inventory only; runtime changes require an agreed window.
- Browser tests use Chrome Main. No on-device agent backups. Do not publish releases or merge stable.
- Commit finished stages only in this branch. Read this file first after context compaction.

## Plan and acceptance gates
1. Source/runtime inventory and route matrix; Go boundary and native ABI; dependency/target proof.
2. Rust bootstrap, isolated root, TLS/auth/config/static UI; contract tests and real UI login.
3. Sessions/roles/HID/USB and system/config APIs; differential tests of responses and side effects.
4. Native media subscriptions/MJPEG/Direct, audio and WebRTC; protocol/transport tests.
5. Integration/addons (including RustDesk without Go bridge), terminal/files/MCP, updates/APK/OpenRC.
6. Reproducible riscv64 musl package/image; independent host and sandbox checks.
7. Agreed device window: full UI compatibility and stability/latency/performance comparisons.

## Current evidence
- Exact branch verified. Stage 1 inventory committed as 4556d2e; stage 2 committed as 240d818e53eee49863881c097ff821f7598c906f. Working tree clean immediately after that commit.
- Bounded stage 3 settings/input-core slice committed as 54e73bf. Live WS/HID slice committed as aef607e with 33 host/target tests.
- Parent AGENTS.md read; no nested AGENTS.md present.
- Rust 1.99.0 pinned for the project; global default remains 1.86.0. Generic riscv64 musl binary executes under QEMU.
- 65 host/target tests pass: 31 unit, 20 API, fourteen real WebSocket/HID/LED/coordinator/jiggler/USB fixture tests; 13 actual Go response cases and two-way JWT interoperability. Binding fixes committed as d820817. LED slice committed as c80594e. Ledger: 28/204 implemented in isolation, one partial (/api/ws), 175 pending.
- Live authenticated/origin-checked/revocable WS, bounded HID queues/descriptors, HTTP leases, release/transfer/shutdown and LED REST/WS readiness/replacement/backoff are wired and tested. Manual/addon mode leases, cancellation, held/cooldown and PicoClaw locking are wired. See stage3-coordinator.md and its qualification JSON. Jiggler API/worker/priority/cleanup and actual 15-second timer are tested; see stage3-jiggler.md and qualification JSON. Admin USB reset/profile lifecycle, confined script install and cancellable actions pass; see stage3-usb.md. Internal recover token gate and real companion HTTP exception pass; body waits no longer occupy execution jobs. See stage3-internal-usb.md. Current release SHA256 745af638f9a28b4504cc918933eb7f4c57d0b6c5b4e931e07a1f0195af73bb92, 6,244,504 bytes. No hardware input/media/performance qualification.
- Existing UI login passes in Chrome Main on an isolated loopback Rust server. Real host AND riscv64 musl/QEMU HTTPS certificate validation, 307 redirect, Secure cookie, SIGTERM and occupied-port rejection pass.
- YAML uses maintained serde-saphyr 1.3 with Viper key/null/default fixtures; dependency repository metadata and resolved licenses recorded.
- Select webrtc-rs 0.21.0 (runtime-tokio + crypto-ring) for feature parity: host/target direct and authenticated relay-only ICE/DTLS/SCTP exchanges pass. str0m 0.24.1 host/target direct exchange also passes but needs a separate TURN client; retained as a measured performance alternative. Neither qualifies hardware/browser media yet.
- Go app depends on patched Pion ICE/DTLS/SRTP and RustDesk currently calls Go media/HID/WebRTC bridges.

## Next action
Coordinator e06f78b; jiggler 1f6308d; admin USB lifecycle 1e27189. Internal token/recover/HTTP exception and body-admission fix pass final host/target/TLS checks; commit bounded slice. Continue full USB composition/budget/rollback: virtual-device.go, usb-composition.go, common/windows_pointer.go and request schemas fully read. Preserve exact flag contents and script target on rollback, 20-second stop/start/verify, revision conflict -5, endpoint budget 6 IN/7 OUT, seven required bool pointers, pointer profile association and permanent legacy ACM getty migration. Native monitor/EDID support remains unported; wire a trusted fixture/backend interface before claiming full composition. Then HTTP paste/system and native/media/addons/package/hardware. Keep isolated-command/activation guards. Full USB composition and RustDesk ownership remain required. Windows UNC edits intermittently time out; use WSL Python scripts from Windows work/ with exact-match validation. Do not restart WSL or disturb other work. scripts/check-v3.py, check-v3-transport.py and refresh-v3-oracle.py reproduce qualification. NK_V3_PLATFORM points to matched read-only artifacts under /home/dgrace/nanokvm-astra/work/v2.1-b1-20261004/platform. Runtime still refuses production activation and nonloopback hosts. No media/device parity or performance claim and no stand changes.

## User steering (2026-10-05)
Choose the best maintained upstream projects; do not pick abandoned libraries or constrain the design to the old Rust 1.86 installation. Dependency maintenance/qualification recorded and committed with stage 2; webrtc-rs selected for integrated TURN parity, str0m retained as a measured alternative. No abandoned-project fallback or Go runtime bridge.
Fix implementation defects immediately when found (explicit user steering). This slice corrected boot-marker names before qualification, fail/stale-queue handling and shutdown release; ordinary/dependent origin tests account for Go's default trusted loopback proxies.
